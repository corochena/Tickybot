            <h1>What is TickyBot</h1>
            <p>
                TickyBot is a Slack Bot ðŸ¤– that lets you use support tickets on Slack. 
                This way, you don't need to leave your beloved channel to assist your users, 
                if you don't feel like it.
            </p>
            <p>
                With TickyBot you can easily check if you've received new tickets, 
                change their status, or write a reply, and the ticket will instantly 
                update itself on our site.
            </p>
            <p>
                Support requests shouldn't be handled through Slack's direct messages.<br>
